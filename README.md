☕ Cafe Our World – A Simple & Aesthetic Café Website

Welcome to Cafe Our World, a small personal project where I tried to blend clean design, simple UI, and smooth browsing experience using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project helped me explore web design, responsive layouts, animations, and a bit of real-world café vibe on the web.
It's not a “big framework project”… just pure frontend development done with love. 💛
